# Water_Quality_Analysis_Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes water quality data to determine whether water is potable (safe for drinking) based on various chemical and physical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and other factors.
The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization to understand patterns affecting water potability.
